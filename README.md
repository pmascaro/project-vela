### Creating the project

##### Creating venv

This sections is based on the following youtube tutorial: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brJR5Qjp4SM

and https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/source-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command

In the terminal, use: python -m venv venv

This creates the virtual environment and now we need to activate it. To do so, use:

if you use windows use the following: venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Aside note: remember that 'chdir' command prints the path in the terminal

To deactivate it, simply type: deactivate

Note: To check for interpreter, use 'python'
